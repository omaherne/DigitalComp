## Visual Argument Project

### About / Intro
This visual argument is about how peaceful nature can be. It is meant to be thought provoking and cause self reflection on ones actions.
My hope is for this poster to be posted around on flyers, as well as possibly ads on websites or social media. This flyer is a call to 
action to get the viewer to put their phone down and enjoy their surroundings, wherever they may be.
