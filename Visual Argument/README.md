## Visual Argument Project

### About / Intro
This visual argument is about how peaceful nature can be. It is meant to be thought provoking and cause self reflection on ones actions.
My hope is for this poster to be posted around on flyers, as well as possibly ads on websites or social media. This flyer is a call to 
action to get the viewer to put their phone down and enjoy their surroundings, wherever they may be.

### Reflection / Creator's Statement
My overall purpose for the Visual Argument was to encourage people to throw their phone away and put themselves in nature. A man is pictured in a small 
row boat, tossing his phone into the water with the words "Look Up." written below. The whole scene is very calming due to the blue shades used. 
I tried to make this argument very minimalist. A lot of the ad's or flyers we see use very bold and bright colors, but that was not my goal. 
I wanted people to look at my piece and not be crazed with color and a lot of words, but I wanted them to realize that nature is a peaceful place
and somewhere where you can go to get away from all the hustle and bustle of the world. I did this by trying to find a photo that was very simplistic
and I found the perfect photo. I muted some of the colors in gimp by changing the hue, and then filling in the colors again. I didn't want to bring too 
much attention to the phone (ie. make it too big or colorful), but I added small gray lines to accentuate it's existence a little bit more. I wanted to
get the idea that nature is a place of peace across and I think that by not cluttering the image and leaving a lot of white space. I hope this gave the chance for the 
viewer to really think about how much we are immersed in our phones and how absent we are in our connection with nature.
