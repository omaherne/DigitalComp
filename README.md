So far I have included some of the audio files I have been using and normalized the audio so that it wasn't too loud for the listener. 
There is a screenshot of me using the normalize effect. I still need to get more audio, as it is hard to get clean audio in the boat. I wasn't able to check out a 
voice recorder this week, but hoping to get it today so that the audio files can be crisper.
