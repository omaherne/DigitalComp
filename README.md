So far I have included some of the audio files I have been using and normalized the audio so that it wasn't too loud for the listener. 
There is a screenshot of me using the normalize effect. I still need to get more audio, as it is hard to get clean audio in the boat. I wasn't able to check out a 
voice recorder this week, but hoping to get it today so that the audio files can be crispier. One thing I am currently working on is the structure of the audio files, 
I am going to make a plan of how I want my audio to flow so that I can record those specific parts.
