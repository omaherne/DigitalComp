## Soundscape Project

### About / Creators Statement
This audio project is an introduction to the sport of rowing. Not many people are aware of how hard this sport really is, and how much hard
work it takes to be good. This project gives a brief overview of what it's like to go to a rowing practice. It starts out very calm and easy, however most days 
consist of intense workouts for long periods of time. This sport is all about teamwork and working hard, but also having fun and bonding with your teammates. 

### Part One: The Start
So far I have included some of the audio files I have been using and normalized the audio so that it wasn't too loud for the listener. 
There is a screenshot of me using the normalize effect. I still need to get more audio, as it is hard to get clean audio in the boat. I wasn't able to check out a 
voice recorder this week, but hoping to get it today so that the audio files can be crispier. One thing I am currently working on is the structure of the audio files, 
I am going to make a plan of how I want my audio to flow so that I can record those specific parts.

### Part Two: The Final Draft
After collecting (most) of the sounds I needed, I then made a plan about how I wanted to tell the story about rowing. I knew I wanted it to start off calming and relaxing, 
and then build intensity to show the competitibe nature of the sport as well. I think I did a good job of that, but might need some more work introducing what rowing really is. 
Below are some screenshots of how I editted the audio so it sounded nice all together. Some of the clips were taken on different devices, so I had to work to make all of the
clips sound similar volume-wise. One of the strategies I used to do this was crossfading, this made the transition between different audio recordings very seamless as if it was 
all one clip.

I also used fading in and out of clips as I transitioned from the calming background of rowing to the intense interval workouts we have done so it wasn't such an abrupt change.

And finally I used the auto-duck effect so the background sounds of rowing got quiet when I was talking in the voice-over. This helps the listener focus on my voice and not get
distracted by all of the sounds playing at the same time.

### Part 3: Reflection
This project was extremely fun. I got a chance to do a project on something that I really enjoy doing, and this doesn't happen very often. I was able to collect sounds across the span 
of 3 days in order to complete this project. I think one of the hardest parts was making the sounds seem as if they were recorded on the same day. I also was only able to use my phone
to record the sounds, and the quality might have been better if I used a sounds recording device from the hillman library. On another note, I had a really good time delving into the 
audio editting to get this project sounding exactly how I envisioned it. I loved recording my audio, but personally I feel like the process of finding audio / footage is also really cool. 
I was able to include this when I thought of the idea to put a house music beat in the background of our rowing. More often than not, rowers are listening to this style of music. House/EDM
maintains a beat throughout the whole song, and also has a lot of energy to it; something that keeps us rowers going through the hard workouts. Overall, I think this project turned out
very close to how I first imagined it going. If I were to do one thing differently in the future, I would just collect more audio so that the listeners get an even better immersion into 
the sport of rowing. Our practice times and weather conditions made it ultimately difficult to get good quality audio that I felt I could include in the project.
