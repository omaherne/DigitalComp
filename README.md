### Part One: The Start
So far I have included some of the audio files I have been using and normalized the audio so that it wasn't too loud for the listener. 
There is a screenshot of me using the normalize effect. I still need to get more audio, as it is hard to get clean audio in the boat. I wasn't able to check out a 
voice recorder this week, but hoping to get it today so that the audio files can be crispier. One thing I am currently working on is the structure of the audio files, 
I am going to make a plan of how I want my audio to flow so that I can record those specific parts.

### Part Two: The Final Draft
After collecting (most) of the sounds I needed, I then made a plan about how I wanted to tell the story about rowing. I knew I wanted it to start off calming and relaxing, 
and then build intensity to show the competitibe nature of the sport as well. I think I did a good job of that, but might need some more work introducing what rowing really is. 
Below are some screenshots of how I editted the audio so it sounded nice all together. Some of the clips were taken on different devices, so I had to work to make all of the
clips sound similar volume-wise. One of the strategies I used to do this was crossfading, this made the transition between different audio recordings very seamless as if it was 
all one clip.

I also used fading in and out of clips as I transitioned from the calming background of rowing to the intense interval workouts we have done so it wasn't such an abrupt change.

And finally I used the auto-duck effect so the background sounds of rowing got quiet when I was talking in the voice-over. This helps the listener focus on my voice and not get
distracted by all of the sounds playing at the same time.
